// A building has 100 floors. One of the floors is the highest floor an egg can be 
//dropped from without breaking.

// If an egg is dropped from above that floor, it will break. If it is dropped 
//from that floor or below, it will be completely undamaged and you can drop 
//the egg again.

// Given two eggs, find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from without 
//breaking, with as few drops as possible.

// Gotchas
// We can do better than a binary ↴ approach, which would have a worst case of 
//50 drops.

// We can even do better than 19 drops!

// We can always find the highest floor an egg can be dropped from with a 
//worst case of 14 total drops.

//Breakdown
//What if we only had one egg? How could we find the correct floor?

//Because we can't use the egg again if it breaks, we'd have to play it safe 
//and drop the egg from every floor, starting at the bottom and working our 
//way up. In the worst case, the egg won't break until the top floor, so we'd 
//drop the egg 100 times.

//What does having two eggs allow us to do differently?

//Since we have two eggs, we can skip multiple floors at a time until the first egg 
//breaks, keeping track of which floors we dropped it from. Once that egg breaks 
//we can use the second egg to try every floor, starting on the last floor where 
//the egg didn't break and ending on the floor below the one where it did break.

//How should we choose how many floors to skip with the first egg?

//What about trying a binary approach? We could drop the first egg halfway up the 
//building at the 50th floor. If the egg doesn't break, we can try the 75th floor 
//next. We keep going like this, dividing the problem in half at each step. 
//As soon as the first egg breaks, we can start using our second egg on our 
//(now-hopefully narrow) range of possible floors.

//If we do that, what's the worst case number of total drops?

//The worst case is that the highest floor an egg won't break from is floor 
//48 or 49. We'd drop the first egg from the 50th floor, and then we'd have 
//to drop the second egg from every floor from 1 to 49, for a total of 50 drops. 
//(Even if the highest floor an egg won't break from is floor 48, we still won't 
//know if it will break from floor 49 until we try.)

//Can we do better than this binary approach?

//50 is probably too many floors to skip for the first drop. In the worst case, 
//if the first egg breaks after a small number of drops, the second egg will 
//break after a large number of drops. And if we went the other way and 
//skipped 1 floor every time, we'd have the opposite problem! What would 
//the worst case floor be then?

//The worst case would be floor 98 or 99—the first egg would drop a large number 
//of times (at every floor from 2-100 skipping one floor each time) and the 
//last egg would drop a small number of times (only on floor 99), for a total 
//of 51 drops.

//Can we balance this out? Is there some number between 50 and 1—the number of 
//floors we'll skip with each drop of the first egg—where the first and second 
//eggs would drop close to the same number of times in the worst case?

//Yes, we could skip 10 floors each time. The worst case would again be 
//floor 98 or 99, but we'd only drop the first egg 10 times and the 
//second egg 9 times, for a total of 19 drops!

//Is that the best we can do?

//Let's look at what happens with this strategy each time the first egg doesn't 
//break. How does the worst case total number of drops change?

//The worst case total number of drops increases by one each time the first egg 
//doesn't break

//For example, if the egg breaks on our first drop from the 10th floor, 
//we may have to drop the second egg at each floor between 1 and 9 for a worst case 
//of 10 total drops. But if the egg breaks when we skip to the 20th floor we will 
//have a worst case of 11 total drops (once for the 10th floor, once for the 20th, 
//and all of the floors between 11 and 19)!

//How can we keep the worst case number of drops from increasing each time 
//the first egg doesn't break?

//Since the maximum number of drops increases by one each time we skip the same 
//amount of floors, we could skip one fewer floor each time we drop the first egg!

//But how do we choose how many floors to skip the first time?

//Well, we know two things that can help us:

//We want to skip as few floors as possible the first time we drop an egg, 
//so if our first egg breaks right away we don't have a lot of floors to drop 
//our second egg from.

//We always want to be able to reduce the number of floors we're skipping by one. 
//We don't want to get towards the top and not be able to skip any floors any more.
//Now that we know this, can we figure out the ideal number of floors to skip 
//the first time?

//To be able to decrease the number of floors we skip by one every time we move up, 
//and to minimize the number of floors we skip the first time, we want to end up 
//skipping just one floor at the very top. Can we model this with an equation?

//Let's say nn is the number of floors we'll skip the first time, and we know 
//1 is the number of floors we'll skip last. Our equation will be:

//n+(n−1)+(n−2)+…+1=100
//How can we solve for n? Notice that we're summing every number from 1 to n.

//The left side is a triangular series.Knowing this, can we simplify and 
//solve the equation?

// We know the left side reduces to:

// \frac{n^2 + n}{2} 
// 2
// n 
// 2
//  +n
// ​	
 
// so we can plug that in:

// and we can rearrange to get a quadratic equation:

// n^2 + n - 200 = 0

// which gives us 13.651

//We can't skip a fraction of a floor, so how many floors should we skip the 
//first time? And what's our final worst case total number of drops?

// Solution
// We'll use the first egg to get a range of possible floors that contain the 
// highest floor an egg can be dropped from without breaking. To do this, 
// we'll drop it from increasingly higher floors until it breaks, skipping 
// some number of floors each time.

//When the first egg breaks, we'll use the second egg to find the exact highest 
//floor an egg can be dropped from. We only have to drop the second egg starting 
//from the last floor where the first egg didn't break, up to the floor where 
//the first egg did break. But we have to drop the second egg one floor at a time.

//With the first egg, if we skip the same number of floors every time, 
//the worst case number of drops will increase by one every time the first 
//egg doesn't break. To counter this and keep our worst case drops constant, 
//we decrease the number of floors we skip by one each time we drop the first egg.

//When we're choosing how many floors to skip the first time we drop the first egg, we know:

//We want to skip as few floors as possible, so if the first egg breaks right 
//away we don't have a lot of floors to drop our second egg from.
//We always want to be able to reduce the number of floors we're skipping. 
//We don't want to get towards the top and not be able to skip floors any more.
//Knowing this, we set up the following equation where nn is the number of 
//floors we skip the first time:

//n+(n−1)+(n−2)+…+1=100
//This triangular series ↴ reduces to n∗(n+1)/2=100 which solves to give n = 13.651
//We round up to 14 to be safe. So our first drop will be from the 14th floor, 
//our second will be 13 floors higher on the 27th floor and so on until the 
//first egg breaks. Once it breaks, we'll use the second egg to try every floor 
//starting with the last floor where the first egg didn't break. At worst, 
//we'll drop both eggs a combined total of 14 times.

// For example:

//   Highest floor an egg won't break from
// 13

// Floors we drop first egg from
// 14

// Floors we drop second egg from
// 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

// Total number of drops
// 14
//   Highest floor an egg won't break from
// 98

// Floors we drop first egg from
// 14, 27, 39, 50, 60, 69, 77, 84, 90, 95, 99

// Floors we drop second egg from
// 96, 97, 98

// Total number of drops
// 14

//What We Learned
//This is one of our most contentious questions. Some people say, "Ugh, 
//this is useless as an interview question," while others say, "We ask 
//this at my company, it works great."

//The bottom line is some companies do ask questions like this, so it's worth 
//being prepared. There are a bunch of these not-exactly-programming interview 
//questions that lean on math and logic. There are some famous ones about 
//shuffling cards and rolling dice. If math isn't your strong suit, don't fret. 
//It only takes a few practice problems to get the hang of these.
