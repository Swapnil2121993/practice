//You're working on a secret team solving coded transmissions.

//Your team is scrambling to decipher a recent message, worried it's a plot 
//to break into a major European National Cake Vault. The message has been 
//mostly deciphered, but all the words are backward! Your colleagues have 
//handed off the last step to you.

//Write a function reverseWords() that takes a message as an array of characters 
//and reverses the order of the words in place. ↴

//Why an array of characters instead of a string?

//The goal of this question is to practice manipulating strings in place. 
//Since we're modifying the message, we need a mutable ↴ type like an array, 
//instead of JavaScript's immutable strings.

//For example:

// const message = [ 'c', 'a', 'k', 'e', ' ',
//                 'p', 'o', 'u', 'n', 'd', ' ',
//                 's', 't', 'e', 'a', 'l' ];

// reverseWords(message);

// console.log(message.join(''));
// Prints: 'steal pound cake'

//When writing your function, assume the message contains only letters and spaces, 
//and all words are separated by one space

//Gotchas
//We can do this in O(1) space. Remember, in place. ↴
//We can do this in O(n) time.

//If you're swapping individual words one at a time, consider what 
//happens when the words are different lengths. Isn't each swap O(n) time 
//in the worst case?

//Breakdown
//Let’s start with a simpler problem. What if we wanted to reverse all the 
//characters in the message?

//Well, we could swap the first character with the last character, then the 
//second character with the second to last character, and so on, moving 
//towards the middle. Can you implement this in code?

// function reverseCharacters(message) {

//   let leftIndex = 0;
//   let rightIndex = message.length - 1;

//   // Walk towards the middle, from both sides
//   while (leftIndex < rightIndex) {

//     // Swap the left char and right char
//     const temp = message[leftIndex];
//     message[leftIndex] = message[rightIndex];
//     message[rightIndex] = temp;
//     leftIndex++;
//     rightIndex--;
//   }
// }

//Ok, looks good. Does this help us?

//Can we use the same concept but apply it to words instead of characters?

//Probably. We'll have to figure out a couple things:

//How do we figure out where words begin and end?
//Once we know the start and end indices of two words, how do we swap those 
//two words?

//We could attack either of those first, but I'm already seeing a potential 
//problem in terms of runtime. Can you guess what it is?

//What happens when you swap two words that aren't the same length?

//the eagle has landed
// [ 't', 'h', 'e', ' ', 'e', 'a', 'g', 'l', 'e', ' ',
//   'h', 'a', 's', ' ', 'l', 'a', 'n', 'd', 'e', 'd' ];

//Supposing we already knew the start and end indices of 'the' and 'landed', 
//how long would it take to swap them?

//O(n) time, where n is the total length of the message!

//Why? Notice that in addition to moving 'the' to the back and moving 'landed' to 
//the front, we have to "scoot over" everything in between, since 'landed' is 
//longer than 'the'.

//So what'll be the total time cost with this approach? Assume we'll be able 
//to learn the start and end indices of all of our words in just one 
//pass O(n) time.O(n^2) total time. 

//Why? In the worst case we have almost as many words as we have characters, 
//and we're always swapping words of different lengths. For example:

//"a bb c dd e ff g hh"

//We take O(n) time to swap the first and last words (we have to move all n 
//characters):

  // input: a bb c dd e ff g hh
// [ 'a', ' ', 'b', 'b', ' ', 'c', ' ', 'd', 'd', ' ',
//   'e', ' ', 'f', 'f', ' ', 'g', ' ', 'h', 'h' ];

// first swap: hh bb c dd e ff g a
// [ 'h', 'h', ' ', 'b', 'b', ' ', 'c', ' ', 'd', 'd',
//   ' ', 'e', ' ', 'f', 'f', ' ', 'g', ' ', 'a' ];

// Then for the second swap:

  // input: a bb c dd e ff g hh
// [ 'a', ' ', 'b', 'b', ' ', 'c', ' ', 'd', 'd', ' ',
//   'e', ' ', 'f', 'f', ' ', 'g', ' ', 'h', 'h' ];

// first swap: hh bb c dd e ff g a
// [ 'h', 'h', ' ', 'b', 'b', ' ', 'c', ' ', 'd', 'd',
//   ' ', 'e', ' ', 'f', 'f', ' ', 'g', ' ', 'a' ];

// second swap: hh g c dd e ff bb a
// [ 'h', 'h', ' ', 'g', ' ', 'c', ' ', 'd', 'd',
//   ' ', 'e', ' ', 'f', 'f', ' ', 'b', 'b', ' ', 'a' ];

//We have to move all n characters except the first and last words, and a 
//couple spaces. So we move n-5 characters in total.

//For the third swap, we have another 5 characters we don't have to move. 
//So we move n-10 in total. We'll end up with a series like this:

//n + (n-5) + (n-10) + (n-15) + ... + 6 + 1
//This is a subsection of the common triangular series. ↴ We're just skipping 
//4 terms between each term!

//So we have the sum of "every fifth number" from that triangular series. 
//That means our sum will be about a fifth the sum of the original series! 
//But in big O notation dividing by 5 is a constant, so we can throw it out. 
//The original triangular series is O(n^2) and so is our series with every fifth element!

//Okay, so O(n^2) time. That's pretty bad. It's possible that's the best we 
//can do...but maybe we can do better?

//Let's try manipulating a sample input by hand.

//And remember what we did for our character-level reversal...

//Look what happens when we do a character-level reversal:

  // input: the eagle has landed
// [ 't', 'h', 'e', ' ', 'e', 'a', 'g', 'l', 'e', ' ',
//   'h', 'a', 's', ' ', 'l', 'a', 'n', 'd', 'e', 'd' ];

// character-reversed: dednal sah elgae eht
// [ 'd', 'e', 'd', 'n', 'a', 'l', ' ', 's', 'a', 'h', ' ',
//   'e', 'l', 'g', 'a', 'e', ' ', 'e', 'h', 't' ];

//Notice anything?

// What if we put it up against the desired output:

  // input: the eagle has landed
// [ 't', 'h', 'e', ' ', 'e', 'a', 'g', 'l', 'e', ' ',
//   'h', 'a', 's', ' ', 'l', 'a', 'n', 'd', 'e', 'd' ];

// character-reversed: dednal sah elgae eht
// [ 'd', 'e', 'd', 'n', 'a', 'l', ' ', 's', 'a', 'h', ' ',
//   'e', 'l', 'g', 'a', 'e', ' ', 'e', 'h', 't' ];

// word-reversed (desired output): landed has eagle the
// [ 'l', 'a', 'n', 'd', 'e', 'd', ' ', 'h', 'a', 's', ' ',
//   'e', 'a', 'g', 'l', 'e', ' ', 't', 'h', 'e' ];

//The character reversal reverses the words! It's a great first step. 
//From there, we just have to "unscramble" each word.

//More precisely, we just have to re-reverse each word!

//Solution
//We'll write a helper function reverseCharacters() that reverses all the 
//characters between a leftIndex and rightIndex. We use it to:

//Reverse all the characters in the entire message, giving us the correct 
//word order but with each word backward.
//Reverse the characters in each individual word.
  function reverseWords(message) {
  // First we reverse all the characters in the entire message
  reverseCharacters(message, 0, message.length - 1);
  // This gives us the right word order
  // but with each word backward

  // Now we'll make the words forward again
  // by reversing each word's characters

  // We hold the index of the *start* of the current word
  // as we look for the *end* of the current word
  let currentWordStartIndex = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i <= message.length; i++) {

    // Found the end of the current word!
    if (i === message.length || message[i] === ' ') {
      // If we haven't exhausted the string our
      // next word's start is one character ahead
      reverseCharacters(message, currentWordStartIndex, i - 1);
      currentWordStartIndex = i + 1;
    }
  }
  return message.join('')
}

function reverseCharacters(message, leftIndex, rightIndex) {

  // Walk towards the middle, from both sides
  while (leftIndex < rightIndex) {

    // Swap the left char and right char
    const temp = message[leftIndex];
    message[leftIndex] = message[rightIndex];
    message[rightIndex] = temp;
    leftIndex++;
    rightIndex--;
  }
}

//desc = 'multiple words different lengths';
let input = 'yummy is cake bundt chocolate'.split('');
//actual = input.join('');
//expected = 'chocolate bundt cake is yummy';
//assertEqual(actual, expected, desc);
console.log(reverseWords(input))

//Complexity
//O(n) time and O(1) space!

//Hmm, the team used your function to finish deciphering the message. 
//There definitely seems to be a heist brewing, but no specifics on 
//where. Any ideas?

// Bonus
// How would you handle punctuation?

//What We Learned
//The naive solution of reversing the words one at a time had a worst-case O(n^2)
//runtime. That's because swapping words with different lengths required 
//"scooting over" all the other characters to make room.

//To get around this "scooting over" issue, we reversed all the characters 
//in the message first. This put all the words in the correct spots, but 
//with the characters in each word backward. So to get the final answer, 
//we reversed the characters in each word. This all takes two passes 
//through the message, so O(n) time total.

//This might seem like a blind insight, but we derived it by using a clear strategy:

//Solve a simpler version of the problem (in this case, reversing the characters 
//instead of the words), and see if that gets us closer to a solution for 
//the original problem.
